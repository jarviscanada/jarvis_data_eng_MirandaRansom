# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I joined Jarvis right after graduatating with my BCS[H] - Computer Science from the University of Windsor. I've aimed to join my theoretical background with practical application through my exteracurriculars such as hackathons and joning the Google Developers Student Club as a core member. I've also had the opportunity to work with a local-non profit as part of their tech team developing a MERN stack application with the main goal of data collection and analysis. Looking forward I'm excited to solve problems through software, build things, and continue learning in such a vast field.

    description: "This project is used to log linux data and tracks potential outages. The script running on the network switch collects hardware and usage data from the nodes and logs them into a postgresql database. The nodes send hardware data on start up and then usage data every minute by the use of a crontab. An outage is detected when a node has not sent at least 3 data points in the past 5 minutes found via an SQL select query."
