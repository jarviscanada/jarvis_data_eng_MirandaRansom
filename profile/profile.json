The script running on the network switch collects hardware and usage data from the nodes and logs them into a Postgresql database.

I've aimed to join my theoretical background with practical application through my extracurriculars such as hackathons and joining the Google Developers Student Club as a core member. I've also had the opportunity to work with a local-non profit as part of their tech team developing a MERN stack application with the main goal of data collection and analysis. Looking forward I'm excited to solve problems through software, build things, and continue learning in such a vast field."
