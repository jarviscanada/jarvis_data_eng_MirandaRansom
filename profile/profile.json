I've aimed to join my theoretical background with practical application through my exteracurriculars such as hackathons and joning the Google Developers Student Club as a core member. I've also had the opperunity to work with a local-non profit as part of their tech team developing a MERN stack application with the main goal of data collection and analysis. Looking forward I'm excited to solve problems through software, build things, and continue learning in such a vast field."
